The obligations of either party to provide indemnification under this Agreement will be contingent upon the indemnified party (i) providing the indemnifying party with prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is sought (provided that the indemnified party’s failure to notify the indemnifying party will not diminish the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Section 12 except to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure), (ii) cooperating fully with the indemnifying party (at the indemnifying party’s expense), and (iii) allowing the indemnifying party to control the defense and settlement of such claim, provided that no settlement may be entered into without the consent of the indemnified party if such settlement would require any action on the part of the indemnified party other than to cease using any allegedly infringing or illegal content or services. Subject to the foregoing, an indemnified party will at all times have the option to participate in any matter or litigation through counsel of its own selection at its own expense.

	13. Disclaimer of Warranties.

	17.4.

	17.5. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, and the competent courts in the city of New York shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear any disputes arising hereunder.

	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
	      as of the date such litigation is filed.

	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
	      meet the following conditions:

	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	          stating that You changed the files; and

	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
	          the Derivative Works; and

	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	          as modifying the License.

	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	      the conditions stated in this License.

	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
	      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
	      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

	   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

	      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
